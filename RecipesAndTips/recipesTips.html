                    <div class="textOneContainer">

                        Inspired by the traditional eating patterns of southern Italy and Greece, the Mediterranean diet is deemed
                        “the gold standard in preventive medicine,” due to its “harmonic combination” of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, 
                        according to a review of studies. Rich in fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and fish, this diet yields health benefits,
                        including increased life expectancy, reduced risk of chronic disease and improved quality of life. What’s more, the Mediterranean diet 
                        is easy to adopt, thanks to its slew of resources—which range from supportive apps to meal delivery services.
                        “It’s not surprising that the Mediterranean diet ranked number one,” says Jackie Newgent , a registered dietitian, 
                        Forbes Health Advisory Board member and panelist for our best diets ranking. “First, it’s not a ‘diet’ as we have come 
                        to think of diets; it’s a lifestyle. Following it means you will be selecting foods that are fresh and wholesome—and you’ll 
                        have plenty of flexibility. Because it’s designed more as an eating lifestyle, it doesn’t lead to ‘yo-yo’ dieting. There are no 
                        ‘good’ or ‘bad’ food lists to choose from.”
